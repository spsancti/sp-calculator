# SP Calculator

The thing you can see here is my labor work of course "Software programming". 

## Features

The main feature of this work - is to mock calculator of Windows 7 with all bugs, imprecision and strange behavior.
So, if you see something starange - it is completely normal for this project.

At the moment it can:

*  Basic arithmetic operations
*  Square and percent
*  Memory operations

## Installing

The project is distributed AS IS. No binaries provided. 

You will need Java and Ant installed. When you have this, simply run ```ant jar``` and hope for binary calc.jar in bin/ directory.

If you want to test it, run ```ant test```.

If you want just compile it, run ```ant compile```.

## Possible problems

It can start on your machine, however, it can decide not to start. 

## Techical characteristics

_Not less_ than for Windows 7. You can try to use it with something weaker but there's no guarantee. 

## Support and liability

If you need support, help or you have ideas for the future release - you are free to fork it and do it yourself.

If you _really_ need help, write some mail here support@sponpu.freshdesk.com or use live chat right here.

Happy hacking!
